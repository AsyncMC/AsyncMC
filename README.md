# AsyncMC

Welcome to AsyncMC, this project is being setup right now, information about it will be published soon.

To correctly check out the project, execute this command:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 -b bleeding
```

The `master` branch will hold only stable code while `bleeding` will hold all the work in progress.

If you didn't clone using the command above, 
use the `setup-submodule.bat` (Windows) or `setup-submodule.sh` (All others) 
to fix your submodules.
